These tutorials how get things done in WinUI3.
WinUI is a great framework but it can give even the experienced programmer sometimes a really hard time. 
With these tutorials I try to help you avoid (too much) pain with WinUI and help you to get things done more easily. 

A wrapped up my experience from an 18 month project where a MFC based projected had been retrofitted and the UI has been moved to WinUI3.
You should have some base knowledge about WinUI.
The tutorials are about how to solve common tasks. I also speak a lot about the common pitfalls you're usually confronted with using WinUI.

If not explicitely mentioned otherwise, I use C++ to program WinUI.
